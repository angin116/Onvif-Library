Remember that any changes you make to which WSDLs are used needs to be reflected in the build files and in the visual studio project files
The specific options chosen in the build files all work together, but if any changes need to be made the options are in the gsoap docs

1. build01 
2. add #import "wsse.h" in the onvif.h and change #import "wsdd10.h" to #import "wsdd.h"
3. build02
4. build03
